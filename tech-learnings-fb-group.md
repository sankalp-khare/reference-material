Putting down here the content I've shared in the facebook group "tech learnings" over the past 3 years, ish.
This was for my cousins pursuing computer science. In the order they were posted, oldest first.

_copied over most of the description/comments/remarks for each link from the group_

## [Bash Scripting Tutorial on linuxconfig.org](https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial)

This one has come in handy _so_ many times. It has concise listing of things like "what's the condition to put in an if conditional for checking if a file exists?", common keywords/patterns etc. Very useful while programming shell.

## [Greg's BashFAQ](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ)

Amazing reference. Straight usable answers to things like "how do I read input line-by-line in bash?" and much more. There's also a Bash Guide available there now. 

## [The Bash Guide](https://guide.bash.academy)

Got this on Twitter. Haven't checked it out myself.

## [Why Python is important for you](http://blaag.haard.se/Why-Python-is-important-for-you/)

Summarizes quite well some of the reasons why I want you to program in a variety of languages and not be limited to merely C/C++/Java, which are taught at most colleges in India.

## [Timsort (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort)

Pays to know this kind of sorting algorithm also exists.
Maybe you want to do an implementation of Timsort!

## [What is REST?](https://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/whatisrest.html)

Big word in web technologies these days.

## [Study | Daniel Meissler](https://danielmiessler.com/study/)

Excellent collection of articles and reference material on this guy's site. Most of which are worthy of your attention.

## [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca)

Zines, articles, tutorials. Lots of great reference material by the amaze b0rk!

* [even `b0rk` makes mistakes](https://twitter.com/tomtastic/status/855903203841454080) But she has the drive to go on learning regardless

## [Salted password hashing --- Doing it right](https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm)

Salted passwords are a common practice. For example linuxes store user passwords as salted hashes.

> Recall the tip I gave you about not saying "no account exists with this username" in the forgot password page. Instead printing a generic message like "if you have an account with us you will have received an email to reset your password".
> The same wisdom is applicable to login pages as well:
> "never tell the user if it was the username or password they got wrong. Always display a generic message like "Invalid username or password." This prevents attackers from enumerating valid usernames without knowing their passwords."
> These are tiny, but highly practical, details of security that you should build knowledge of, as you go along! :)

## [Principles of Programming Languages | Venkatesh Choppella @ IIIT-H](http://pascal.iiit.ac.in/~choppell/popl/#org5650c46)

The [course website](http://pascal.iiit.ac.in/~choppell/popl/) contains a lot of useful reading. Most colleges in the country do not do Principles of Programming Languages like Dr. Choppella does. It's very highly recommended.

Check out the reference material section, order the books or find copies somehow. And then read the sections indicated in the lecture plan.

## [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam)

Contest they do every year. If you're into competitive coding, this is worth checking out.

## [Networking for System Administrators](https://mwl.io/nonfiction/networking#n4sa)

Nice book. If you use a Linux machine, or virtualization, or are generally curious about how the network works, do check out. Not a very big book either.

## [Google Summer of Code | Student Guide](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/what-is-google-summer-of-code/)

Selection in GSoC is a big deal. It brings with it
1) The opportunity to work with some really smart and driven people doing Open Source
2) Exposure to how the Open Source ecosystem works
3) A great achievement to add to your resume
4) Good amounts of money (3-4 lakh INR)
5) Foreign Trips, in case of certain organizations like GNOME, Mozilla etc. that have the money to pay for you to come meet everyone (such trips usually take you to Europe / USA)
It is only open to college-going people. You have limited attempts!

## [Fun at the UNIX Terminal | Part 1](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1483)

Just to give you an idea...

## [Summer of Haskell](https://summer.haskell.org/ideas.html)

If you dig functional programming, got to check this out. Similar to GSoC, but in Haskell.

## [IISc. Summer School](https://events.csa.iisc.ac.in/summerschool2018/)

Try applying for this. Good chance to meet with students from other parts of the country. Get an idea where you stand!

## Some articles on Version Control

* [Atlassian Bitbucket Tutorials --- What is Version Control](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)
* [Why you need version control | Free Range Statistics Blog](http://freerangestats.info/blog/2016/09/16/version-control)
* [Beanstalk Guides: An introduction to Version Control](http://guides.beanstalkapp.com/version-control/intro-to-version-control.html)
* [An introduction to collaborating with version control | Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/an-introduction-to-collaborating-with-version-control/overview)
